# Mobile Flashcards Project

This is my finished code for the third project for Udacity's React Nanodegree program

Users particpate by creating "decks" centered around a given subject, to which they add "cards" that they
can quiz themselves on, to help prepare themselves for an exam.
The app has been tested on Android and iOS, though was developed primarily on an Android Studio emulator.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## TL;DR

To run this yourself:

* clone the project to your local machine with `git clone https://github.com/Brodt7258/mobile-flashcards.git`
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* for help using other scripts, or setting up a dev environment, please refer to https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md

## Data

The app uses the AsyncStorage API from React Native.  Changes should persist between sessions, though crashes during development can cause data loss.
